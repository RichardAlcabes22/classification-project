#### Welcome to this initial exploration of customer churn at TelcoCo!
##### The goals of this initial exploration are as follows:
- Discover "Driving Factors" which most likely lead customer churn
- Discover the customer segment which is most likely to churn out
- Identify those customers who are within the scope of said target customer segment
- Create a Machine Learning Model which can accurately predict customer churn

##### Initial hypotheses and questions:
- Do customers with "Month-to-Month" contracts churn out at a statistically significant greater rate than the overall population?
- Do customers with "Paperless Billing" enabled churn out at a statistically significant greater rate than the overall population?
- Do customers without "Dependents" churn out at a statistically significant greater rate than the overall population?
- Do customers without "Partners" churn out at a statistically significant greater rate than the overall population?

- Prepare
- Explore
- Model
- Deliver


##### Instructions for those who wish to follow along:
Needed (ALL files must be placed in THE SAME FOLDER!):
    - 1. final_report.ipynb file from this git repo
    - 2. acquire.py file from this git repo
    - 3. prepare.py file from this git repo 
    - 4. env.py file to be generated by IT.  You must use your own env.py file with your own sign-in credentials.  Please contact IT if you are in need of obtaining this.  Otherwise, feel free to create your env.py script with any text editor by following these steps:
            - In your newly opened file, we will place 2 Blocks of Info.  Copy/Paste the following three lines:

            host = <address for database server>
            uname = <your assigned user name>
            pwd = <the password associated with your user name>

            - The 2nd Block of Info: (Copy/Paste this below the 1st Block)
            def get_db_url(u_name,pwd,h_name,db_name):
                return f'mysql+pymysql://{u_name}:{pwd}@{h_name}/{db_name}'
Ensure:
    - All 4 files are in the SAME FOLDER
    - acquire.py, prepare.py, and env.py each have the .py extension in the file name
    - The two Blocks of Info in the env.py file are all aligned at the left-most index of the page EXCEPT the final line of code beginning with "return".  This line should be 4 whitespaces (or 1 TAB) indented from the rest.
